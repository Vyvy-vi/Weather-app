# Weather-app
Weather app in Python using tkinter and openweather API.
NOTE- The API Key was purposefully not hidden.
This is openweatherAPI, which is free to use, so I'll suggest go get your own.
Encrypting it or .gitignoring it will cause difficulties to the users

Go get your own API key from: http://api.openweathermap.org

*This isn't complete yet. I shall make the gui much better with animated icons etc according to the weather and slight size ratios etc. will also be re-built.*
